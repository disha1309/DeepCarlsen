This project is to study and code the chess engine described as Giraffe. Giraffe is an experimental chess engine based on temporal-difference reinforcement learning with deep neural networks. It discovers almost all its chess knowledge through self-play.

The research paper describing Giraffe is :  http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01549

Giraffe is written in C++11. I intend to code it in Python with related libraries. So far in this project I have watched videos on reinforcement learning and image processing for knowledge in those areas as well as gone through tutorials of TensoFlow. I have read 2 blogs in detail describing traditional chess engines like Stockfish and how they function. Further I have read the algorithm behind Alpha Zero and the Monte Carlo Search Tree adopted by it. Lastly I have completely read and understood the paper on Giraffe that details general chess engine algorithms and describes the feature representation and the temporal reinforcement learning model and training.

As the code for Giraffe is open source I intend to refer to it for structural purposes alone. I'll be writing the code differently in Python based on my interpretations of the paper. So far I have not begun coding, I'm first familiarising myself properly with the paper and figuring out how to structure my code.
